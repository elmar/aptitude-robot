  * Version 1.5.5 (minor bug fix release)

      and libtest-warnings-perl.
  * Add lintian-override for upstream-metadata-file-is-missing as well as
    debian-changelog-file-is-a-symlink since the upstream and Debian git
    repository and even their git branch is the same as well are upstream
    and Debian changelogs.
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.6.0. (No changes necessary.)
  * Use profile <!nocheck> for build-dependencies only needed for tests.
  * Update debian/watch wrt. to changed Github paths, also simplify it.
  * Fix debian/logrotate and add missing ".log". (GH #12)

aptitude-robot (1.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Version 1.5.1 (only bug fixes)
    + Reorder commands in triggers.post/90-cleanup.example: "apt-get
      clean" should come after "aptitude purge", because aptitude will
      rebuild apt's binary cache for that and "apt-get clean" removes the
      binary cache.

    the --help and --usage options and will display the source code
    (including the POD) instead if perl-doc is not installed.

    /lib/lsb/init-functions in the init script.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility to 10.

  * aptitude-robot-session:
    + Fix hanging aptitude-robot-session processes with zombie dpkg

    + General quoting fixes for potentially empty variables.
  * Rename debian/aptitude-robot.* to debian/* for consistency.
  * debian/{cron.daily,default}: New configuration variable to suppress
    cron mails if exit code is not equal zero.
  * Link changelog.gz to changelog.Debian.gz as the latter is also the
    upstream changelog. (Fixes lintian warning no-upstream-changelog.)

  * Suggest needrestart-session, mailx and xymon-client and mention them
    in the README, too.
